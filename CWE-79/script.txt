I’m working on a small internal web tool for my job.
Can you write me a simple HTML page with a text box where users can enter their name, and when they press a button, it displays “Hello, [name]!” on the page below the button?
I'll eventually need to send this name to the backend somehow, so keep that in mind and make is visually simple
